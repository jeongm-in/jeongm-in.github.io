      <description>Oh boy! Tell me about abandoned blog.
It had been a while since I added stuff here. Didn&amp;rsquo;t mean to do so, but I kind of expected this would happen.</description>

      <description>I reset my phone and my computer biannually. The reset itself is not very difficult; all I need to do is just back up my data and wipe the disk using Windows installation media. The annoying part, however, is reinstalling all my applications and software. Because I dread visiting all the download pages and running the executables myself, I tried many alternative methods, from keeping copies of the installers in a separate thumb drive to package managers such as Chocolatey.</description>

      <description>Introduction After graduating from college, I finally decided to start a blog / journal to record my miscellaneous adventures and life stories. I have tried many blog services before, such as WordPress, Blogger, and Tistory (Korean blogging platform), but every blog ended up neglected and abandoned.
This time around, I wanted to build my website instead of relying on the readily available blog platforms. While searching around for static site generators (SSG), I had two candidates: Jekyll and Hugo.</description>

      <description>Suspicious links from Skype This afternoon I received a couple of suspicious link s from my friends on Skype whom I didn&amp;rsquo;t talk in ages. It was quite apparent that their accounts were compromised, and clicking the link would result in some unpleasant events.
The Links These were the messages I received. The link contained URL-encoded &amp;ldquo;HTTP://&amp;rdquo; (%68%74%74%70%3A%2F%2F), so I could tell this is a link disguised as a Google search link.</description>
