      <description>Introduction After graduating from college, I finally decided to start a blog / journal to record my miscellaneous adventures and life stories. I have tried many blog services before, such as WordPress, Blogger, and Tistory (Korean blogging platform), but every blog ended up neglected and abandoned.

      <description>Suspicious links from Skype This afternoon I received a couple of suspicious link s from my friends on Skype whom I didn&amp;rsquo;t talk in ages. It was quite apparent that their accounts were compromised, and clicking the link would result in some unpleasant events.
The Links These were the messages I received. The link contained URL-encoded &amp;ldquo;HTTP://&amp;rdquo; (%68%74%74%70%3A%2F%2F), so I could tell this is a link disguised as a Google search link.</description>
